    <h1> HYPERLINKS </h1>
    <p> A hyperlink is a word, phrase, or image that you can click on to jump to a new document or a new section within the current document. Hyperlinks are found in nearly all Web pages, allowing users to click their way from page to page. </p>


<div id="absolute" color="red">
	<h2> Absolute link </h2>
	<p> An absolute link is a hyperlink containing a full URL, which includes all the information needed to find a particular site, page or document or other addressable item on the Internet. </p>
   <ul>
	<li><a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/absolute-link#:~:text=An%20absolute%20link%20is%20a,FTP%20(File%20Transfer%20Protocol)."> defination of Absolute link </a> </li>

	<li><a href="https://sabe.io/classes/html/links"> examples of html absolute link </a></li> </div>

</ul>
    <div id="relative">
	<h2> Relative link </h2>
	<p> A relative link is any link that shows the current URL's relation to the linked page's URL. Instead of having the whole reference URL in the h-ref tag, relative links only show the relative link paths, as their name suggests. It's the difference between a link that has the website's full address, and a link that only includes a file's specific location. </p>

    <div id="image">
	<h2> Image as link </h2>
	<p> It's simple to use an image as hyperlink. We just need to use an image inside hyperlink at the place of text </p>
	<a href="C:\HTML programs/sweets.jpg"> 
		<img src="C:\HTML programs/sweets.jpg" alt= "sweet logo"> </a></div>

    <div id="internal">
	<h2> Internal link </h2>
	<p> An internal link is a link from one page to another page on the same domain. They're simply text hyperlinks from one page to another page on your website. </p>

    <img src="C:\HTML programs/logo.png" alt="planet ">
	</a></div>
<div id="embedded">
	<h2> embedded kinks </h2>
	<p> A little tougher to define, embedded links are just another way of saying a link that when clicked, leads somewhere else. Embedded links can be more than text though. You can embed an image as a link to another page on the web. </p>
